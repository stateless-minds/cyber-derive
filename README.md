# Cyber Dérive

**"Deliveries made fun again."**

---

## The Premise

Cyber Dérive is a p2p local delivery app turned into a deck-building game with collectible magic cards and battles.

In a world of alienation where people rely on companies and centralized institutions to do everything for them Cyber Dérive offers a fresh take on rebuilding community interaction and trust. 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9rive">"The dérive (French: [de.ʁiv], "drift") is an unplanned journey through a landscape, usually urban, in which participants stop focusing on their everyday relations to their social environment."</a>

## How it works

**1. Need something delivered within your city?** 
- Request a delivery
- Someone can deliver it for you while they go out on their daily matters 
- Free of charge

**2. Need a reason to go out more often, stay fit and make new friends?** 
- Open the app
- Get 5 random magic cards
- Choose 3 of them in case there are other users competing to make the delivery
- Participate in a battle
- Win the battle and deliver the parcel
- Get a new random magic card 
- Add it to your collection
- Create new battles with friends

**3. A delivery route is too long for a single person?**
- Post where you can take it to
- Someone else can take it from there
- When multi-party completes a delivery by team work they form a guild
- Guilds get the biggest rewards - one magic card per member on successful delivery**

## FAQ
**1. Would delivery companies allow this?**
 - Yes, delivery companies make their profit margins from bulk long-distance deliveries. Local offices and car fleet are a cost not a profit for them. They would gladly give up on this if people can deliver parcels themselves to their depots. This way they can spend money on trucks, trains and larger depots to increase their long range fleet.

**2. How is theft/fraud prevented without regulation?**
 - There is a reputation system in place. If someone steals your parcel or deceives you in some way you can report it via the abuse/fraud button. On 3 strikes the person is banned from the platform. All users are pseudonymous. This means that their IPs are public and traceable thus you can sort the dispute yourself.

**3. What is the maximum weight of a parcel?** 
- There are no defined limits. People can deliver by foot, bicycle, e-scooter or their personal car. Thus it all depends on the means of transportation in use and a personal evaluation.

**4. Is this activity legal?**
- Of course it's legal. There is no money involved thus it's non-commercial. It's voluntary and no one owns the platform. The app is hosted and operated on a p2p basis thus each user is Cyber Dérive. The source code is open-source and everyone can clone, fork and adapt for their own city and needs.

**5. What happens in case of road accident?**
- The same as it would happen without the game. Use at your own risk. Cyber Dérive is not responsible for your own actions.

**6. What happens in case of crime-related activities and/or forbidden substances/items.**
- Cyber Dérive is not responsible for what is being carried. Each user is solely responsible for own actions. There is no moderation or central authority that governs the activity in the game.
